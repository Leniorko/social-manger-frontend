**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Currently under heavy development and completely unfinished.

There is [backend part](https://github.com/Leniorko/social-manager-backend)

### Tech stack

Every technology was chosen just because author wanted to. Without particular clear reason for it.

- React
- Recoil
- TS
- MUI
- Formik
- Vite
- pnpm


### Decisions made so far
- Perform styling via `sx` prop.
    - Probably later do theming via mui themes.
- Pages are **not** components. Technically they are, but for organization purpose they are not.
