# Social Manager Frontend

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Currently under heavy development and completely unfinished.

There is also will be backend part, but it's to be started yet.
<!-- TODO: Add backend repo link. -->

### Tech stack
- React
- Revolt
- TS
- MUI
- Vite
- pnpm


### Decisions made so far
- Perform styling via `sx` prop.
    - Probably later do theming via mui themes.
- Pages are **not** components. Technically they are, but for organization purpose they are not.
